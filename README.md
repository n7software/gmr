# Giant Multiplayer Robot
A website and service for facilitating PBEM Civ V games, freely accessible at [multiplayerrobot.com](http://multiplayerrobot.com)

# State of Project

This application was written over a decade ago by two Civilization V fans ([Mel "NullMaster"](https://steamcommunity.com/id/NullMaster/) and [Tazzik](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tazz1k)) that wanted a more convenient way to enjoy the multiplayer experience.

It's currently in maintenance mode, being kept going by self-hosting, ocassional updates by the creators, and community support.
